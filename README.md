# KNN---book-recommendation-system

CHAPTER 01 
1.0 Introduction  
 
Nowadays, mostly like leading e-commerce web site and other business-related web, mobile and desktop applications like Spotify, Facebook, YouTube and eBay are using and training machine learning models for getting most successful and productive datasets that regarding to the recommendations on their own functionalities. Because of the recommendation have the ability to maintain the business logic-chain at their present and future business progress.
 
CHAPTER 02
2.1 Selecting suitable dataset

For developing a machine learning model, the first step is, finding suitable dataset for the targeted problem. In this project, I have used two datasets thatâ€™s relating to the above scenario.
The first dataset that I used is books.csv. It includes number so columns and I had to have filter only two columns from this data set.
